# Decision tree

In the first part of this project we used the data set of fetal heart diagnois from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography. This is a classification task where we predicted diagnois type: normal, suspicious, or pathological.

For the second part, we used Iris data set to tune the hyperparameter max_depth to get the best cross-validation performance, and then evaluate the classifier on the test set.

In the next part, we used the data set was created by Sberbank https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market/overview and contains some statistics from the Russian real estate market. The goal is find a suitable model using cross-validation over the training set, and finally evaluate on the held-out test data.

Finally, we implemented a class TreeRegressor for regression with decision trees.
